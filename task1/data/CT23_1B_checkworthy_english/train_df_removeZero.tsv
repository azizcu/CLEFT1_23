15210	that s one major war explosion in a warhead .	No	0
1706	that s not the right answer for america .	No	0

27247	we re 9 million jobs short of that .	Yes	1

1471	and mr . ford has n t done anything about it .	Yes	1
2381	i just do n t know how the president could have come into office facing 23 million people out of work rising unemployment an economic crisis at the at the kitchen table and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the american people .	Yes	1
9756	i said that i d end the war in iraq and i did .	Yes	1
9755	i told you i d cut taxes for small businesses and i have .	Yes	1

Yes	1
3565	but let s be clear earmarks account for 18 billion in last year s budget .	Yes	1
2455	in the meantime folks out there with insurance you re already getting a rebate .	Yes	1
22857	that s what the duelfer report showed .	Yes	1
6990	we balanced the budget in the 90s .	Yes	1
6282	so choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that s already been proven in places in like new orleans and new york city and other places where we have charter schools where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them .	Yes	1
3673	with all due respect you already gave them to the oil companies .	Yes	1

11248	that s part of what happened in afghanistan where we rushed into iraq and senator mccain and president bush suggested that it was n t that important to catch bin laden right now and that we could muddle through and that has cost us dearly .	Yes	1
25066	and he opposed even president carter when toward the end of his term president carter wanted to increase the defense budget .	Yes	1
17645	it has begun to decline but it is still going up .	Yes	1
28829	and incidentally mel carnahan in missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the state of missouri .	Yes	1
14971	the size of government increased only one sixth in california of what it increased in proportion to the population in georgia .	Yes	1
29958	now as far as the lawsuit yes when i was very young i went into my father s company had a real estate company in brooklyn and queens and we along with many many other companies throughout the country it was a federal lawsuit were sued .	Yes	1
24656	the reason magic johnson resigned from the aids commission is because the statement you heard tonight from mr . bush is the longest and best statement he s made about it in public .	Yes	1
8741	and that s simply why i proposed 15 months ago the emergency excise tax on gasoline that i did .	Yes	1
27811	but the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow i would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere .	Yes	1
30287	iran is one of their biggest trading partners .	Yes	1
579	the governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the west .	Yes	1

19229	first of all remember that in this campaign season since senator dole s been a candidate he has bragged about the fact that he voted against medicare in the beginning in 1965 one of only 12 members .	Yes	1
19441	secondly senator dole you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it .	Yes	1
12783	part of that as the gallup polls show is because the soviet union made a breakthrough in outer space .	Yes	1
23531	we have 100 00 to 200 00 embryos that are frozen in nitrogen today from fertility clinics .	Yes	1
4351	that was n t proven when ronald reagan said we would do sdi which is missile defense .	Yes	1
3736	mostly that s just me opposing george bush s wrong headed policies since i ve been in congress but i think it is that it is also important to recognize i worked with tom coburn the most conservative one of the most conservative republicans who john already mentioned to set up what we call a google for government saying we ll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who in fact is promoting some of these spending projects that john s been railing about .	Yes	1
2174	i want to take that 716 billion you ve cut and put it back into medicare .	Yes	1
18676	and while he s been diverted with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our army either going to iraq coming back from iraq or getting ready to go north korea s gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous .	Yes	1
2494	but that s already the law and that does n t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions .	Yes	1
7641	we lost three thousand american lives .	Yes	1
3893	and senator obama who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in iraq and afghanistan .	Yes	1
23248	and most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country .	Yes	1
33610	well first of all before i start on my plan her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes .	Yes	1
2978	the soviet union for instance put pressure on mr . ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world aleksandr solzhenitsyn .	Yes	1
8823	or we passed one bill just a couple of weeks ago in the house of representatives for 500 million a half a billion dollars .	Yes	1
29497	and the only thing that looks good is the stock market but if you raise interest rates even a little bit that s going to come crashing down .	Yes	1
12131	49th for women with health care and 50th for families with health care .	Yes	1
9568	we ve gone from 10 trillion of national debt to 16 trillion of national debt .	Yes	1
3669	and if we want to talk about oil company profits under your tax plan john this is undeniable oil companies would get an additional 4 billion in tax breaks .	Yes	1
27179	our military is second to none in the world .	Yes	1
9816	that s after losing 5 million jobs .	Yes	1
9767	all of those things will make a difference so the point is the commitments i ve made i ve kept .	Yes	1
3993	you ve got cross border attacks against u . s . troops .	Yes	1
32306	first of all captain khan is an american hero and if i were president at that time he would be alive today because unlike her who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing i would not have had our people in iraq .	Yes	1
9636	what we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford .	Yes	1
21576	i ve already taken the pledge on cutting the deficit in half .	Yes	1
13382	and i would also point out that senator kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program a twenty five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay .	Yes	1
2326	now governor romney has said he wants to repeal dodd frank .	Yes	1
23574	another example would be the dred scott case which is where judges years ago said that the constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights .	Yes	1
12684	the charter of the united nations its preamble article i and article ii also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another .	Yes	1
11125	we drove the russians out with the afghan freedom fighters drove the russians out of afghanistan and then we made a most serious mistake .	Yes	1
34413	the affordable care act extended the solvency of the medicare trust fund .	Yes	1
33716	our product is pouring in from china pouring in from vietnam pouring in from all over the world .	Yes	1
25159	and the bottom line is that the united states left in humiliation and our enemies are stronger .	Yes	1
12577	mr . nixon earlier indicated that he would defend quemoy and matsu even if the attack on these islands two miles off the coast of china were not part of a general attack an formosa and the pescadores .	Yes	1
15974	well his campaign manager who used to be the secretary of the treasury was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds and i m happy to join jim baker in saying that we agree on this .	Yes	1
24093	we have a budget deficit in the federal government but we also have an investment a jobs an income deficit .	Yes	1
24155	number one you make more making computer chips than potato chips ; and number 2 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from japan .	Yes	1
22697	he pushed them away time and again pushed them away at the u . n . pushed them away individually .	Yes	1
12761	there we got more votes for condemning hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year .	Yes	1
9384	because the economy was on the verge of collapse because we were about to go through the worst recession since the great depression as a consequence of some of the same policies that governor romney s now promoting .	Yes	1
20338	i don t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers 100 billion comes out of medicare just for the wealthiest 1 in the tax cut .	Yes	1
15728	we re not going to spend billions on mx s on railroad cars which is a weapons system we do n t need cannot afford and wo n t help our defense posture at all .	Yes	1
30027	we learned that bernie sanders was taken advantage of by your people by debbie wasserman schultz .	Yes	1
9801	he said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform medicare and social security because he pointed out they re on the road to bankruptcy .	Yes	1
2336	that s one of the unintended consequences of dodd frank .	Yes	1
27758	the secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating .	Yes	1
6088	senator obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies take over the health care of america through as he said his object is a single payer system .	Yes	1
4266	and senator obama says he s for nuclear but he s against reprocessing and he s against storing .	Yes	1
32480	but we re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent .	Yes	1
6319	i m sure you re aware senator obama of the program in the washington d . c . school system where vouchers are provided and there s a certain number i think it s a thousand and some and some 9 00 parents asked to be eligible for that .	Yes	1
17812	in 1979 we ran a 29 billion deficit all year .	Yes	1
10441	and i believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years strongly promoted by president bush and supported by senator mccain that essentially said that we should strip away regulations consumer protections let the market run wild and prosperity would rain down on all of us .	Yes	1
27911	bringing down our deficit by adding 7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for before we even get to the debt that we currently have that is not going to make us more competitive .	Yes	1
20729	look we ve got the biggest surpluses in all of american history .	Yes	1
8889	but the federal government does n t make money .	Yes	1
7589	senator kennedy also indicated with regard to cuba that he thought that i had made a mistake when i was in cuba in not calling for free elections in that country .	Yes	1
13516	mr . dulles has suggested it s from two to three times as great as ours .	Yes	1
23207	non homeland non defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when i got into office .	Yes	1
3079	we comprise about 30 percent of the world s economic trade power influence .	Yes	1
26119	we ve got home ownership at a 15 year high .	Yes	1
25835	on a per person basis it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs .	Yes	1
12202	that stands in stark contrast by the way to a man who is going to leave 50 million 50 million americans out of tax relief .	Yes	1
25060	and that s an image of strength except that if he had had his way when the nimitz was being planned he would have been deep in the water out there because there would n t have been any nimitz to stand on he was against it .	Yes	1
17791	it would go into the social security trust fund .	Yes	1
8726	we have a coal supply that is equal to 50 of the world s coal supply good for centuries in this country .	Yes	1
33973	no it was we put up the american flag .	Yes	1
8779	and in most cases that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions .	Yes	1
7014	and when i roll it back and we invest in the things that i have talked about to move our economy we re going to grow sufficiently it would begin to cut the deficit in half and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country .	Yes	1
20000	well just for the record when i was governor we had the lowest second lowest tax burden of any state in the country the highest job growth rate of any state when i ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances .	Yes	1
14915	and we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600 00 jobs for young people .	Yes	1
25824	17 new taxes spend 1 . 5 trillion dollars 50 new bureaucracies .	Yes	1
3715	i saved the taxpayers 6 . 8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between boeing and dod that was completely wrong .	Yes	1
6829	and therefore the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care .	Yes	1
24455	seventy two other nations have been able to do it .	Yes	1
20364	but i also dropped the bottom rate from 15 to 10 .	Yes	1
33559	look she s been proven to be a liar on so many different ways .	Yes	1
9139	if you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines we gave you a john and abigail adams scholarship four years tuition free in the college of your choice in massachusetts it s a public institution .	Yes	1
16866	president truman vetoed on the average while he was president about thirty eight bills a year .	Yes	1
21824	they cover 98 of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of america and so does rochester new york .	Yes	1
2949	we have achieved a five and three quarter year uh sale of a minimum six million metric tons which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the american farmers have produced in order to uh have full production .	Yes	1
25811	that could protect 3 million families 700 00 kids .	Yes	1
10869	we can do that we as americans because we re the best innovators we re the best producers and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the united states of america .	Yes	1
20909	governor bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and do n t have to take all applicants .	Yes	1
10550	senator mccain as recently as march bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator .	Yes	1
9641	an economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that cannot finds a job or a college level job that s not what we have to have .	Yes	1
19778	and that s why we ve got a country with ten and a half million more jobs and record numbers of new businesses and rising incomes and falling crime rates and welfare roll rates .	Yes	1
6695	we created a 10 percent bracket to help lower income americans .	Yes	1
33967	the money goes 100 percent 100 percent goes to different charities including a lot of military .	Yes	1
20752	we re talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs 20 00 new bureaucrats .	Yes	1
18144	more in september than in august .	Yes	1
23661	and he was given a chance to vote and he voted no .	Yes	1
10238	and manufacturers here in the u . s . making the same products cannot compete .	Yes	1
12189	because by his own budget numbers his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined .	Yes	1
2147	716 billion we were able to save from the medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we were n t overpaying providers .	Yes	1
9727	that s what took us from surplus to deficit .	Yes	1
22875	that s why in my speech to the congress i said there s an axis of evil iraq iran and north korea and we re paying attention to it .	Yes	1
32570	they started from that little area and now they re in 32 different nations hillary .	Yes	1
1913	my plan is not like anything that s been tried before .	Yes	1
12320	well that vote was n t exactly a lot of the supporters of the kyoto treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded .	Yes	1
34372	because i did disagree with ronald reagan very strongly on trade .	Yes	1
5563	they produce the most jobs .	Yes	1
7825	it also exists among minority groups .	Yes	1
6523	we have a problem with litigation in the united states of america .	Yes	1
32569	i mean her and obama whether you like it or not the way they got out of iraq the vacuum they ve left that s why isis formed in the first place .	Yes	1
19358	you ve suggested a commission newt gingrich did i suggested that at least four or five years ago .	Yes	1
15816	he is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement .	Yes	1
20132	but i believe that my plan is better than senator dole s ill advised 550 billion scheme which i ll say again will blow a hole in the deficit .	Yes	1
7592	and that position is that the united states has a treaty a treaty with all of the organization of american states which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well .	Yes	1
22133	with all this instability and breaking into republics and all the middle eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons we ve got our work cut out for us .	Yes	1
2368	and unfortunately when when when you look at obamacare the congressional budget office has said it will cost 2 500 a year more than traditional insurance .	Yes	1
19871	it costs about 27 00 to pay people to volunteer .	Yes	1
17687	but the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago .	Yes	1
13211	general ridgway said who was chief of staff to go to war for quemoy and matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take .	Yes	1
16854	these programs that i described to you earlier the tax deferrals for overseas the disc and the tax shelters uh they only apply to people in the 50 thousand a year bracket or up and i think this is the very best way to approach it .	Yes	1
13418	even if you put his income up ten percent that would be two and three quarters percent three pers or three cents out of that twenty five cents .	Yes	1
3357	will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation ?	Yes	1
27226	and governor romney our alliances have never been stronger in asia in europe in africa with israel where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation including dealing with the iranian threat .	Yes	1
6703	his record in the united states senate does not match his rhetoric .	Yes	1
25830	we changed many provisions i authored cover preexisting conditions portability and there are other things we can do .	Yes	1
24418	i am concerned about a tax on muslims for example over there .	Yes	1
21034	this is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20 00 people .	Yes	1
16002	it was n t created as a welfare program .	Yes	1
1703	it s small business that creates the jobs in america and over the last four years small business people have decided that america may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30 year low .	Yes	1
19258	but it wo n t be possible to do if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co chair senator d amato says he ll have to cut medicare even more than was cut in the bill that i vetoed .	Yes	1
8459	it failed because the house did not pass it and the house failed by eleven votes .	Yes	1
23138	first he says he s for medical liability reform particularly for ob gyns .	Yes	1
16942	the federal reserve has uh an independent status that ought to be preserved ; i think that mr . uh burns did take a typical erroneous republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high .	Yes	1
34144	and iran should write us a letter of thank you just like the really stupid the stupidest deal of all time a deal that s going to give iran absolutely nuclear weapons .	Yes	1
28280	it s based on the plan of governor jim hunt in north carolina and it works great .	Yes	1
16796	seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country .	Yes	1
10669	my friends some of this 700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations .	Yes	1
17174	the president says it will disappear overnight because of some reason .	Yes	1
17618	you ve got a 260 billion deficit .	Yes	1
711	we have 13 00 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land on sea and in the air enough to blow up the soviet union forty times over .	Yes	1
27442	the disagreement i have with governor romney is that during the course of this campaign he s often talked as if we should take premature military action .	Yes	1
27770	they re stealing our intellectual property our patents our designs our technology hacking into our computers counterfeiting our goods .	Yes	1
2821	and more recently he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars .	Yes	1
6863	that s a large part of your 17 percent increase in medicare premiums .	Yes	1
10168	and it s referred to as an assault weapon ban but it had at the signing of the bill both the pro gun and the anti gun people came together because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted .	Yes	1
2746	we ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent .	Yes	1
3641	here s the only problem your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you re getting from your employer .	Yes	1

32049	last time at the first debate we had millions of people fact checking so i expect we ll have millions more fact checking because you know it is it s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country .	Yes	1
18350	japan is going to have a summit for the donors ; 14 billion pledged .	Yes	1

2154	and the answer is neither the president nor i are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees either to social security or medicare .	Yes	1
12904	he says he supports the president s position .	Yes	1
3765	not only even if we get all 700 billion back let s assume the markets recover we re holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the great depression when roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes over time home values went back up and in fact government made a profit .	Yes	1

8551	now the reason the eisenhower administration has moved the reason that we ve had the funds for example locally to build the schools and the hospitals and the highways to make the progress that we have is because this administration has encouraged individual enterprise ; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight year period .
