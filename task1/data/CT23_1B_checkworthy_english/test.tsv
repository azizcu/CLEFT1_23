11062	if we could have intervened effectively in the holocaust who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in ?	No	0

11094	and i understand that we have to say never again to a holocaust and never again to rwanda .	No	0
11112	and if we have osama bin laden in our sights and the pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out then i think that we have to act and we will take them out .	No	0

11145	it d be fine with me .	No	0

13322	uh also so that we can get the uh opportunity for the questioners to question me it will be before the next television debate .	No	0
13346	the difficulty now is the president s course is quite limited .	No	0
13361	my judgment is that the program the vice president put forward which is an extension of mr . benson s program will cost a billion dollars more than the present program which costs about six billion dollars a year the most expensive in history .	Yes	1
