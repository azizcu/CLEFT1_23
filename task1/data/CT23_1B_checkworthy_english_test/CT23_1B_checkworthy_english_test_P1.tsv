39775	but , guess what , in the meantime , we find out in the new york times the other day that in fact , his folks went to wall street and said , ' this is a really dangerous thing , ' and a memo out of that meeting - not from his administration , but from some of the brokers - said , ' sell short , because we gotta get moving .
39786	but i do n't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position .
39788	you should n't be bringing up wall street .
39793	in fact , we beat hillary clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get .
39794	do n't tell me about wall street .
39806	they will pay a price .
39809	they will pay a price if i 'm elected .
39820	we are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election .

39850	and i 'll tell you , they were so bad .
39851	they took over the , the submarine port .
39856	they were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are , but now , with what came out today , it 's even worse .
39867	we learn that this president paid 50 times the tax in china , has a secret bank account with china , does business in china , and in fact , is talking about me taking money ?
39868	i have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever , ever , number one .
39876	the foreign countries are paying you a lot .
39886	i want to do it , and it will show how successful , how great this company is .

39973	his son did n't have a job for a long time , was sadly no longer in the military service , i wo n't get into that .
39980	everybody investigated that , no one said anything he did was wrong in ukraine .
39994	excuse me , and then unlike him , where he 's vice president , and he does business , i then decided to run for president after that .
40004	what i 'd make china do is play by the international rules , not like he has done .
40018	we need to be having the rest of our friends with us , saying to china , these are the rules .
40025	his son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from china -
40034	first of all , china is paying .
40059	you 're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding , well , we can't get new tires , they 're bald , because we have to wait another month or so .
40075	let 's get off the subject of china , let 's talk around sitting around the table .
40082	so , when i met with barack obama , we sat in the white house , right at the beginning had a great conversation , was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour .
40111	on the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get - - the korean peninsula should be a nuclear free zone .
40138	remember the first two or three months .
40150	through the legislature , i terminated the individual mandate .
40152	the individual mandate - - where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance .
40153	i terminated it ; it 's gone .
40156	i could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy .
40163	i do n't know that it 's going to work .
40168	what i would like to do is a much better health care , much better .
40169	we 'll always protect people with pre-existing - so i 'd like to terminate obamacare , come up with a brand new beautiful health care .
40172	and i think we 're going to win the house , okay ?
40173	you 'll see , but i think we 're gonna win the house .
40175	we have 180 million people out there that have great private health care , far more than we 're talking about with obamacare .
40212	it 's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as , as well as a whole range of other people who in fact , are concerned in the medical field .
40214	and this is going to give some people an opportunity , an opportunity to have health care for their children , how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in god 's name are you going to do if you get sick ?
40218	excuse me , he was there for 47 years - he did n't do it .
40245	and they 're going to have lower premiums , you can buy into the better plans , the cheaper plans , lower your premiums , deal with unexpected billing , and have your drug prices drop significantly .
40252	and this whole country will come down .
40263	and the idea that we 're in a situation and are going to destroy medicare - this is the guy that the actuary of medicare said , ' if in fact ' - and , social security - ' if , in fact , he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on social security , social security will be bankrupt by 2023 , with no way to make up for it .
40271	go back and look at the records .
40286	what happens to the ordinary people out there ?
40291	and he does n't come from scranton .
40313	and it 's gone through , including the democrats , in all fairness .
40331	and look at what 's happening .
40338	what 's the matter with these guys .
40342	we were going to take care of everything for them .
40349	if i get elected , i 'm not gonna - i 'm running as a proud democrat , but i 'm gonna be an american president .
40351	what i see is american , united states .
40356	they allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the united states of america .
40361	i do , because i think one of the things we 're gonna have to do is we 're gonna have to bail them out , too .
40365	they passed a package that allows us to be able to call ppp , money 's supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely .
40374	i think it should be a state option .
40378	we have to help , it 's very important .
40416	and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper .
40422	but a lot of these kids come out without the parents , they come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs .
40439	who built the cages , joe ?
40443	and now they can not find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone .
40455	i 'd love you to ask that , who built the cages ?
40464	and the fact is , i 've made it very clear , within 100 days , i 'm going to send to the united states congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people .
40482	the catch and release , you know what he 's talking about there ?

40546	all the things we can do .
40580	ten-year , long term funding , and i gave them more money than they asked for , because i said , ' i think you need more ' .
40585	the fact of the matter is , in 2000 though , after the crime bill had been in the law for a while , this is the guy who said , ' the problem with the crime bill , there 's not enough people in jail .
40594	and secondly , we 're in a situation here where we - the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration .
40597	no one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem .
40642	that 's exactly what - that 's exactly what - -
40659	i thought it was a terrible thing .
40663	i do n't , i do n't know what to say .

40701	one of the things is that in the ' 80s , we passed 100 % , all 100 senators voted for it , a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs .
40705	they should be going into treatment across the board .
40706	that 's what we should be spending money on .
40724	you did n't get anything done .
40726	38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison .
40734	why did n't you do it ?
40737	you put tens of thousands of mostly black young men in prison .

40747	sometimes you gotta talk ' em into it .
40759	we have the best , lowest number in carbon emissions , which is a big standard that i noticed obama goes with all the time .
40771	i will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs , thousands and thousands of companies because of the paris accord .
40783	we have a moral obligation to deal with it .
40792	we 're going to be in a position where we 're going to see to it that we 're going to take 4 million existing billion , buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they do n't leak as much energy , saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs .
40799	they came out and said very strongly , ' $ 6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan ' , that his plan is an economic disaster .
40805	look , their real plan costs $ 100 trillion .
40831	he thinks wind causes cancer , windmills .
40836	we are energy independent for the first time .

40882	if you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for hispanic , or black , or asian , it 's nine times greater , the percentage gain than it was under - in three years - than it was under eight years of the two of them , to put it nicely .
40889	we saved our oil industry and now it 's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline .
40916	and i 'd stop giving to the oil industry - i 'd stop giving them federal subsidies .
40917	you wo n't give federal subsidies to the gas and , excuse me , to solar and wind .
40946	we have to make our country totally successful , as it was prior to the plague coming in from china .
40950	we had the best black unemployment numbers in the history of our country , hispanic , women , asian , people with diplomas , with no diplomas , mit graduates , number one in the class - everybody had the best numbers .
