39615	What should they do about the danger?
39625	They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves.
39627	The fact is, that when we knew it was coming, when it hit - what happened?
39673	Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.

39747	We have to open up and we understand the disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them.
39775	But, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, 'this is a really dangerous thing,' and a memo out of that meeting - not from his administration, but from some of the brokers - said, 'sell short, because we gotta get moving.
39786	But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position.
39788	You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street.
39793	In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get.
39794	Don't tell me about Wall Street.
39806	They will pay a price.
39809	They will pay a price if I'm elected.
39820	We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election.
39823	He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true.
39837	Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia.
39839	You got three and a half million dollars.
39840	Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain - why did you get three and a half?
39841	I never got any money from Russia.
39848	I sold - while he was selling pillows and sheets - I sold tank busters to Ukraine.
39850	And I'll tell you, they were so bad.
39851	They took over the, the submarine port.
39856	They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse.
39867	We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, has a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money?
39868	I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one.
39876	The foreign countries are paying you a lot.
39886	I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is.
39895	So, I already prepaid it.
39902	Number two, I don't make money from China, you do.
39908	I don't know, maybe you're not.
39910	Your son said we have to give 10% to the big man.
39918	I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated.
39938	Come on, come on, folks.
39940	I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years.
39973	His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that.
39980	Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.
39994	Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that.
40004	What I'd make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done.
40018	We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules.
40025	His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China -
40034	First of all, China is paying.
40059	You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they're bald, because we have to wait another month or so.
40075	Let's get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table.
40082	So, when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour.
40111	On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get -- the Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.
40138	Remember the first two or three months.
40150	Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate.
40152	The individual mandate -- where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance.
40153	I terminated it; it's gone.
40156	I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy.
40163	I don't know that it's going to work.
40168	What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better.
40169	We'll always protect people with pre-existing - so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care.
40172	And I think we're going to win the House, okay?
40173	You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House.
40175	We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare.
40212	It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field.
40214	And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick?
40218	Excuse me, he was there for 47 years - he didn't do it.
40245	And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly.
40252	And this whole country will come down.
40263	And the idea that we're in a situation and are going to destroy Medicare - this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, 'If in fact' - and, social security - 'If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to make up for it.
40271	Go back and look at the records.
40286	What happens to the ordinary people out there?
40291	And he doesn't come from Scranton.
40313	And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness.
40331	And look at what's happening.
40338	What's the matter with these guys.
40342	We were going to take care of everything for them.
40349	If I get elected, I'm not gonna - I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president.
40351	What I see is American, United States.
40356	They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.
40361	I do, because I think one of the things we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too.
40365	They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money's supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely.
40374	I think it should be a state option.
40378	We have to help, it's very important.
40416	And then they had a picture in a certain newspaper.
40422	But a lot of these kids come out without the parents, they come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs.
40439	Who built the cages, Joe?
40443	And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone.
40455	I'd love you to ask that, who built the cages?
40464	And the fact is, I've made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people.
40482	The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there?
40488	That's never happened before in America.
40492	They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.
40496	Catch and release is a disaster.
40532	She has a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work.
40546	All the things we can do.
40580	Ten-year, long term funding, and I gave them more money than they asked for, because I said, 'I think you need more'.
40585	The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, 'The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail.
40594	And secondly, we're in a situation here where we - the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration.
40597	No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem.
40642	That's exactly what - That's exactly what--
40659	I thought it was a terrible thing.
40663	I don't, I don't know what to say.
40664	I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones.
40666	I don't know what to say.
40676	He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims.
40689	I didn't say 'I'm Abraham Lincoln'.

40705	They should be going into treatment across the board.
40706	That's what we should be spending money on.
40724	You didn't get anything done.
40726	38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison.
40734	Why didn't you do it?
40737	You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison.
40741	You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.
40747	Sometimes you gotta talk 'em into it.
40759	We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time.
40771	I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord.
40783	We have a moral obligation to deal with it.
40792	We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs.
40799	They came out and said very strongly, '$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan', that his plan is an economic disaster.
40805	Look, their real plan costs $100 trillion.
40831	He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills.
40836	We are energy independent for the first time.
40844	Find me a scientist that says that.
40851	But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry.
40852	You want -- and what about fracking?
40855	I have never said I oppose fracking.
40882	If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nine times greater, the percentage gain than it was under - in three years - than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely.
40889	We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline.
40916	And I'd stop giving to the oil industry - I'd stop giving them federal subsidies.
40917	You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind.
40946	We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China.
40950	We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates, number one in the class - everybody had the best numbers.
40954	Success is going to bring us together.
40960	Your 401K's will go to hell and it'll be a very, very sad day for this country.
40971	We're going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better.
40972	We can grow this economy.
