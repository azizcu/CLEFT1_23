We\nhave listened to this guy for many, many years\nin this country, on his moral high horse\nassaulting the dignity of gay people, across the\nboard. His moral preening is famous throughout\nthe land. Yet he is the most obsequious of all\nTrump's cultists in the cabinet.\n\"There have been occasions, as George Will\npoints out, where speaking on Trump, in front\nof Trump, Pence compliments him on an\naverage of every 3.2 seconds.\n\"We have never seen such slobbering servility\nby a high government official in this country\nthan we do in Mike Pence and Donald Trump. It\nis amazing. He's supposed to be serving the\nAmerican people. He's the Vice President of the\nUnited States, and he acts like he's the house\nbutler at Mar-a-Lago.\" - Steve Schmidt\nImage Credit.

DOH, however, continues to guarantee the public that all necessary precautionary\nmeasures are being taken to halt the spread of the virus.\nThe confirmed case arrived in the Philippines from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong last January\n21, 2020. The patient sought consult and was admitted in one of the country's government\nhospitals last January 25 after experiencing mild cough. She is currently asymptomatic.\n\"I assure the public that the Department of Health is on top of this evolving situation. We were\nable to detect the first confirmed case because of our strong surveillance system, close\ncoórdination with World Health Organization and other national agencies, and the utilization of\nDOH's decision tool. We are working closely with the hospital where the patient is admitted and\nhave activated the Incident Command System of the said hospital for appropriate management,\nspecifically on infection control, case management, and containment. We are also implementing\nmeasures to protect the health staff providing care to these patients,\" Health Secretary Francisco\nT.

The Task Force will convene a high-level meeting tomorrow, January 31, 2020, to\ndiscuss the first confirmed case and developments arising from this health event.\nThe Bureau of Quarantine remains on high alert and is in constant coordination with authorities\nfrom all ports of entry for stricter border surveillance.
