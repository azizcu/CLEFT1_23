Wait, are you really arguing that we shouldn't
consider pesky historical facts when they get in the
way of our narrative? isn't that just actual feels over
facts irrationalism? How do you decide what's
""evident"" and what's ""mystification"" if evidence isn't
valid?
When I see Rodger, first and foremost I see a
narcissist who took refuge in any kind of fringe
belief that allowed him to maintain a certain self-
image. The ""what"" he took refuge in is just what you
have described it to be, but that doesn't mean that
you can lay his behaviour entirely or even primarily
at the feet of that ideology. I'd consider the
psychological explanation what's evident and the
political framing the mystification.

When the primary sub-source was questioned.

As written: ""shortly after the FBI filed the Carter Page FISA Renewal""  (January 12th, 2017). https://t.co/C5gMZZsW34","The FBI Identifies and Interviews the Primary Sub-Source in
Early 2017
C.
An important aspect of the FBI's assessment of Steele's election reporting
involved evaluating Steele's source network, especially whether the sub-sources
had access to reliable information. As noted in the first FISA application, Steele
relied on a primary sub-source (Primary Sub-source) for information, and this
Primary Sub-source used a network of sub-sources to gather the information that
was relayed to Steele; Steele himself was not the originating source of any of the
factual information in his reporting.334 The FBI employed multiple methods in an
effort to ascertain the identities of the sub-sources within the network, including
meeting with Steele in October 2016 (prior to him being closed for cause) and
conducting various investigative inquiries. For example, the FBI determined it was
plausible that at least some of the sub-sources had access to intelligence pertinent
to events described in Steele's election reporting. Additionally, the FBI's evaluation
of Steele's sub-sources generated some corroboration for the election reporting
(primarily routine facts about dates, locations, and occupational positions that was
mostly public source information). Further, by January 2017 the FBI was able to
identify and arrange a meeting with the Primary Sub-source. 335
The FBI conducted interviews of the Primary Sub-source in January, March,
and May 2017 that raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele
election reporting. In particular, the FBI's interview with Steele's Primary Sub-
source in January 2017, shortly after the FBI filed the Carter Page FISA Renewal
333 We discuss the FBI's conclusions about the reporting in Section V of this chapter.
334 When interviewed by the FBI, the Primary Sub-source stated that
The Primary Sub-source was
335 Steele did not disclose the identity of the Primary Sub-source to the FBI.

PLEASE TAKE TIME TO READ
Corona virus awareness
This is from a doctor in Hong Kong who consulted with his
friend (who currently works on SARS prevention research)
on some effective ways to prevent the Coronavirus. Worth a
read.
About the virus:
1. It is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm
diameter), so any normal mask (not just the N95 feature)
should be able to filter it out. However, when someone who's
infected sneezes in front of you, it will take a great 3 meters
(about 10 feet) before it drops to the ground and is no longer
airborne.
2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live for at
least 12 hours. So remember if you come in contact with any
metal surface, wash your hands with soap thoroughly.
3. The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12 hours.
Normal laundry detergent should kill the virus. But if you are
really worried, you can add some non-chlorine bleach or
oxygen bleach . For winter clothing that does not require
daily washing, you can put it out under the sun to kill the
virus.
About the symptoms of the pneumonia caused by
Coronavirus:
1. It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have the dry
sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4 days
2. Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and drips into
the trachea and enter the lungs, causing pneumonia. This
process will take 5 to 6 days.
3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in
breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind.
You will feel like you are drowning in water. It's important to
go seek immediate medical attention if you feel like this.

Steve Hanke: You Should
Like The Plague
Johns Hopkins
University professor Steve Hanke has once
again taken a shot at Bitcoin. In his new
tweet, he says that the cryptocurrency that
started it all should be avoided like 'the
plague' because it is used to fund Kim Jong
Un's nuclear game plan.

In June of 2011, I took steps to consolidate the Bitcoin that I mined with Bitcoin
that I acquired and other assets. In October 2012, a formal trust document was
executed, creating a trust whose corpus included the Bitcoin that I mined, acquired and
would acquire in the future. The name of that trust is TulipTrust. It was formed in the
Seycelles. I refer to this trust below as Tulip Trust I.

While the trustee was initially David Kleiman, additional trustees were appointed
upon the execution of the formal trust document.

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses
that are common among animals. In rare
cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic,
meaning they can be transmitted from
animals to humans.
The viruses can make people sick, usually
with a mild to moderate upper respiratory

Continental sheift
within the CO2 theory of climate. The problem-
a fact that makes the CO2 theory look astronomically
unlikely – is how planetary temperatures and CO2
levels consistently peak right when the planet starts
running out of ice to melt. You see, in each of the 5 most
recent climate tops (""interglacial periods"") we
have believable ice-core data on, temperatures
approached a couple degrees higher than today.
And obviously, a couple degrees higher, and Earth
will start to run out of ice to melt. After all, Earth is already
starting to run out of ice to melt, isn't it?

20) Here is a greatly exaggerated profile of the
Continental margin. Sea-erosion of the continents is
something that mostly happens near the ocean's surface,
in the wave and tidal zone. Then, over the eons, and
countless climate cycles, as sea levels
cycled between ice-ages and warm-ages, wave and
280
tidal action eroded the continental shelf. The

remarkable abruptness of the continental break in
non-polar regions around the world speaks of a
climate bottom that as remained relatively constant for
eons. If the climate bottom temperature had varied by
much, the continental break would have a rounded

5. 新型冠状病毒感染可以被治愈吗?
所有病毒感染都有一定的自限性,目前已经有新
型冠状病毒感染被治愈的案例(截至1月27日24
时,国家卫生健建康委收到30个省(区、市)累计
治愈出院60例))。
从目前收治的病例情况看,多数患者预后良好,
儿童病例症状相对较轻,少数患者病情危重。死
亡病例多见于老年人和有慢性基础疾病者。
感染症状轻微的患者多数在一周后恢复健康。
良好的个人生活习惯,如:勤洗手、良好的心
情、充足的睡眠、多喝水、营养支持等,都能在
早期感染时给予一定的帮助!

INSIDE: New York's tabloid rivalry, in covers / Star turn for Denzel's son
Homes destroyed by the Carr fire in Redding, California, on July 27.
THERE HAS BEEN a lot of burning lately. In late July, wildfires
broke out in the Arctic Circle, where temperatures reached
almost 90 degrees and roiled northern Sweden. Farther south,
wildfires swept along the Greek seaside, outside Athens, killing
at least 91 and hospitalizing almost 200. At one resort, dozens
tried to escape the flames by descending a narrow stone stair-
case into the Aegean, only to be engulfed along the way, dying
literally in each other's arms.
In the American West, 89 major wildfires have burned this year,
including one, in California, that grew at the rate of 1,000 acres
each hour and another, in Colorado, that produced a volcanolike
300-foot eruption of flames, swallowing an entire subdivision and
leading to the invention of a new term-""fire tsunami."" Then came
the Carr fire, which burned through Redding, California. It
destroyed more than a thousand homes, melted nearby boats, and

From the booklet included with YES 50 LIVE, available now as 2CD, 4LP, and Digital Download.

https://t.co/RU6Dhwcu2d https://t.co/UeoQZFFXqL","""What an amazing achievement for everyone
associated with Yes. I can only say how
privileged I feel to have been a part of this
whole experience. Yes music is timeless, it is
an incredible catalogue of works, and I am very
grateful to have had the opportunity
to perform with some of the most gifted and
talented musicians on the planet.
The ride has been a roller coaster at times,
but somehow the spirit
rise above and shine through.
I sincerely hope there is more to come from
this wonderful band, and that I can be a part of
Yes always seems to

the continuity of the band. Thank you, Yes, and

write this book to alert the world of our imminent danger. I wrote this book
in 4 days. During that time I learned things I never knew, or even thought
about in my entire life. The knowledge I acquired from my Cosmic sources
shocked me. But the information contained herein is what they wanted me
to relate. I've done my best to present the information in a comprehensive
yet digestible form. Even though many of you will find this very hard to
Tomthunkit's
Theory of thhe
Universe
swallow.
We are at the intersection of critical mass and times up. Because of our
actions, the time we have left
vanishing fast due to the climate crisis
we've created. We have brought impending doom upon us; unless we unite
to take drastic measures, and make an immediate course correction. We
have run out of highway becausẻ our Creators have run out of patience.
This book is not about me. I cannot solve the problems listed in this book.
I did what I was told. It's up to you and your world leaders to do the rest. Time
is of the essence because we have been scheduled for replacement, which
is planned and ready: but we have been given one more chance for survival.
What we do with it, is up to each and every individual.
The Greatest Siery Ever Told
Read this book. This book lays out a compelling case for immediate action.
It debunks both theories of our origin; Creationism and Evolution. It proves
with clear, convincing, and irrefutable evidence that we were created by
Superior Beings. Our Creators are not happy. We will not be allowed to
destroy this planet (our only home and theirs) and their other creations
before they replace us.
This book contains an URGENT message about your future and the future of
our planet. Everyone SHOULD read this. It maybe the most important book
you ever read. Share it.
One World Left. One Race - Human, One mission: SAVE THE PLANET.
If you care about the people you love and your survival, read this book; then
make an informed decision. Or dismiss it at your peril. This is ngt a joke,
fiction, fantasy or written to scare you. This is yeur FINAL WARNING.

there isn't a forest fire nearby, then the skies can be beautiful and pristine and
clear as can be. But if a lightning strike causes a forest fire, then all of a sudden
we are engulfed in smoke. It is proof that man's role in carbon emissions is
insignificant. As l've said before, carbon-based transportation represents about
100 years of the 4.5 billion years of our planet; a lightning strike and ensuing
wildfire emits hundreds or maybe even thousands of times the amount of carbon
of all of our cars put together.

Novel Coronavirus
Frequently Asked Questions
Q) How does the virus spread ?
Ans- The specific modes of transmission of the virus is not clear yet since
it is a novel virus. This virus probably originally emerged from an
animal source but now seems to be spreading from
person-to-person. It's not clear yet how easily 2019-nCoV spreads
from person-to-person. It is thought to have happened mainly when
an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and
other respiratory pathogens spread.
Q) What is Gol doing about 2019-nCoV?
Ans- A 24*7 helpline has been setup by the Gol at NCDC, New Delhi to
answer all queries regarding the disease. The Gol is closely
monitoring the situation and has ascertained the level of
preparedness in every State of India. As this is an emerging, rapidly
evolving situation the Gol will continue to provide updated
information as it becomes available.
Q) Is there a vaccine to get protection from 2019 novel Corona Virus ?
Ans- Currently, there is no vaccine available to protect against
2019- novel Corona Virus.

Latest discussion on what the virus should be labelled: https://t.co/yIKspZPrMf","WHO recommends that the interim name of the disease causing the current
outbreak should be ""2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease"" (where 'n' is for novel
and 'CoV' is for coronavirus). This name complies with the WHO Best Practices for
Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases, which were developed through a
consultative process among partner agencies. Endorsement for the interim name
is being sought from WHO's partner agencies, World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The final name of the
disease will be provided by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). WHO
is also proposing '2019-nCoV' as an interim name of the virus. The final decision
on the official name of the virus will be made by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses.
