Scientists at the University of Exeter say a dolphin who learned a complex trick in captivity has taught it to nine of her
friends and family since she was released into the wild. Pictured left is the dolphin, named Billie, who learnt to 'tailwalk'
while recovering from pollution poisoning in a dolphinarium in Adelaide. Billie marks the only known example of a
mammal teaching human tricks to its peers in the wild without any help from a human trainer. The skill allows dolphins
to adapt new behaviours faster than they would through natural selection, potentially giving them the edge over rapid
changes to their environment caused by global warming.

I'm one of the millions in Wuhan right now who is
affected by this. It is heartbreaking to see comments
here saying how we deserve it.
Yes. Some people are disgusting and uneducated, they
eat everything that moves and have total disregard for
health/safety regulations. But most people aren't like
that. Most of us are just normal folks living a normal life.
We are just as angry at those exotic animal traders as
you are, if not more.
It's CNY, and in case you're not familiar with the Chinese
culture, let me first put into perspective it's importance.
It's like thanksgiving and Christmas combined.
Historical/Traditional significance aside, for millions of
people, CNY is the only time of the year where families
get to reunite and have a home cooked meal together. It
is more common than not for chinese people in more
rural areas to go to cities to find better work
opportunities. They work hard for the whole year,
sending home the little money they earn to support their
children and parents. Families don't get to see each
other for a whole year and reunion dinner on CNY eve is
something everyone looks forward to.
The coronavirus is taking away the only time of the year
that families get to reunite. Doctors and nurses are
working around the clock, many of them have not gone
home in weeks; healthcare professionals across China
are flying voluntarily to Wuhan to help; factory workers
have resumed work due to the shortage of masks and
protective suits; 3M and other companies are donating
masks too; hotels across Wuhan have offered free
accomodation to healthcare professionals whose home
are too far away; chain convenient stores are providing
free hot meals to hospitals and workers; delivery man
have to give up their holidays to deliver food to families
because we can't leave our homes; construction workers
are working around the clock to build new hospitals... do
all these people working tireless to save lives deserve to

19) Now sea levels 135m down is a curious statistic. This
is because it exactly matches to the average depth of the
non-polar continental break, which is also about 135m
down depending on how we measure it. The continental
break is where the barely sloping continental shelf
abruptly becomes the continental edge, and a steep
descent to the deep sea floor, as shown below.

18) Now again, when new volcanic air comes up, it tends
to come up as a froth of super-high pressure gas and
super-hot magma from deep within the planet. The high
pressure gas accounts for how the froth rises, and how it
forces its way out through the lithosphere.
Figure 1.12

As this super-hot magma cools, it gives off heat
warming Earth's oceans and surface. But in cooling, it also
accretes as rock the sea floor rift/ridge ‚Äì like a tongue
touched to frozen metal, but on geological time scale. So
while the bubbles of CO2-rich new volcanic air replenish
the atmosphere and bring up magma that warms the
surface, they also drive sea-floor spreading. Then this
seafloor spreading drives earthquakes, plate margin
volcanos, and continental drift. Thus these 'soda bottle'
gas bubbles are Gaia's primary driving force, directly or
indirectly giving rise to all active geology, as well as
atmosphere and climate. Here is why the full version of
this theory is also named ""The Unified Gaia Theory""
Note the abrupt edge at the continental break. The
average width of the continental shelf is 60km and the fall
is 135m, thus it has a remarkably shallow 0.225%-slope
on average.

February 12 O-
To clarify my position on government regulations: I am not generally in favor
of regulations. The fewer, the better. But there are exceptions.
For example, I believe we can all agree that it would be outright crazy to
allow anyone to handle certain aerosol-transmissible pathogens. In this
case, we demand strict regulations. This is because we know that if
something goes wrong, it might affect a lot of people, including us.
Now I believe that certain algorithms, such as Google's search algorithm,
which affect billions of people, are also one of those exceptions. We need to
make sure that these algorithms are not abused for large scale public
opinion manipulations. We need to enforce the transparency, verifiability,
accountability and security of these algorithms.
The temporary deletion of Trump's Twitter account should have been a
wake-up call. Even if we were to trust these companies not to manipulate us
in their own interest, or the interest of a government, one rogue employ with
sufficient access could at the right time wield unprecedented power.
Imagine a similar situation as the Cuban Missile Crisis. What could one
foreign agent or mentally unstable employee provoke by posting something
in the name of a head of state or by sending a few billion people a message
about imminent doom?
Right now we are in a situation in which street food is better regulated than
the products of companies that could affect election outcomes, cause mass
panics or even nuclear wars.

¬ª Who are signing? Singapore, Brunei, New Zealand,
Chile, Australia, Peru, Vietnam,
Malaysia, Mexico, Canada, Japan
WHAT HAS
CHANGED?
¬ª Not much. Most major TPPA
provisions are expected to remain
despite their changed significance

Agricultural provisions that
would allow industrialized

highly subsidized agricultural
imports into developing

conditions are sure to worsen as developlng
countries push down wages, benefits and labor

Department of Health
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
DOH CONFIRMS FIRST 2019-NCOV CASE IN THE COUNTRY; ASSURES PUBLIC
OF INTENSIFIED CONTAINMENT MEASURES
Press Release / 30 January 2020
The Department of Health (DOH) today confirmed that a 38-year-old female Chinese patient
under investigation (PUI) is positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) after her laboratory
results arrived today from the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne,
Australia. DOH, however, continues to guarantee the public that all necessary precautionary
measures are being taken to halt the spread of the virus.
The confirmed case arrived in the Philippines from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong last January
21, 2020. The patient sought consult and was admitted in one of the country's government
hospitals last January 25 after experiencing mild cough. She is currently asymptomatic.
""I assure the public that the Department of Health is on top of this evolving situation. We were
able to detect the first confirmed case because of our strong surveillance system, close
co√≥rdination with World Health Organization and other national agencies, and the utilization of
DOH's decision tool. We are working closely with the hospital where the patient is admitted and
have activated the Incident Command System of the said hospital for appropriate management,
specifically on infection control, case management, and containment. We are also implementing
measures to protect the health staff providing care to these patients,"" Health Secretary Francisco
T. Duque III said.
DOH is also in close coordination with the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious
Diseases (EID) which includes representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs (DFA),
Interior and Local Government (DILG), Justice (DOJ), Labor and Employment (DOLE),
Tourism (DOT), Transportation (DOTT), and Information and Communications Technology
(DICT). The Task Force will convene a high-level meeting tomorrow, January 31, 2020, to
discuss the first confirmed case and developments arising from this health event.
The Bureau of Quarantine remains on high alert and is in constant coordination with authorities
from all ports of entry for stricter border surveillance. DOH assured that its health facilities are
equipped and prepared to receive and care for PUIS and confirmed 2019-nCoV cases.

Findings Of the 99 patients with 2019-CoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood T Lg o

Interpretation The 2019-aCoV infection was of chustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities,
and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, d
characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MulBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting e
mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to esplore the applicability of the MulBSTA KOre in tat
predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-Cov infection.

write this book to alert the world of our imminent danger. I wrote this book
in 4 days. During that time I learned things I never knew, or even thought
about in my entire life. The knowledge I acquired from my Cosmic sources
shocked me. But the information contained herein is what they wanted me
to relate. I've done my best to present the information in a comprehensive
yet digestible form. Even though many of you will find this very hard to
Tomthunkit's
Theory of thhe
Universe
swallow.
We are at the intersection of critical mass and times up. Because of our
actions, the time we have left
vanishing fast due to the climate crisis
we've created. We have brought impending doom upon us; unless we unite
to take drastic measures, and make an immediate course correction. We
have run out of highway becaus·∫ª our Creators have run out of patience.
This book is not about me. I cannot solve the problems listed in this book.
I did what I was told. It's up to you and your world leaders to do the rest. Time
is of the essence because we have been scheduled for replacement, which
is planned and ready: but we have been given one more chance for survival.
What we do with it, is up to each and every individual.
The Greatest Siery Ever Told
Read this book. This book lays out a compelling case for immediate action.
It debunks both theories of our origin; Creationism and Evolution. It proves
with clear, convincing, and irrefutable evidence that we were created by
Superior Beings. Our Creators are not happy. We will not be allowed to
destroy this planet (our only home and theirs) and their other creations
before they replace us.
This book contains an URGENT message about your future and the future of
our planet. Everyone SHOULD read this. It maybe the most important book
you ever read. Share it.
One World Left. One Race - Human, One mission: SAVE THE PLANET.
If you care about the people you love and your survival, read this book; then
make an informed decision. Or dismiss it at your peril. This is ngt a joke,
fiction, fantasy or written to scare you. This is yeur FINAL WARNING.

Elrond Blockchain To Help Solidify
Crypto Liquidity Aggregator Orion
Elrond, a recently launched high-performance
blockchain network, announced it has
partnered with Orion Protocol to help solidify
its crypto liquidity platform.
Orion Protocol is a liquidity aggregator that
connects centralized and decentralized
exchanges to give cryptocurrency users
access to more volume and tighter spreads.
By deploying a set of smart contracts for
managing liquidity and matching and execut-
ing orders directly between different chains,
traders have access to more liquidity than
any single exchange and more markets that
they can trade with less friction and costs.

Calving Indicates TOO MUCH ICE!
Redford: Time to step up game on climate change - CNN.com
We know what's driving the problem of climate change, and we know what to do
about it, writes Robert Redford.
Climate morons believe that glaciers calving are an indication of ""climate change""
Glaciers are rivers of ice that flow towards the sea. Snow falls in the interior, and
eventually finds its way to the ocean via gravity. All of the snow that falls, has to return to
the sea. In the case of Greenland, that is 500 billion tons of ice per year.
Their logic is as intelligent as saying all the water flowing out the mouth of the Mississippi
is an indication of drought. Complete imbeciles.

that are common among animals. In rare

The idea is to watch 2 things:
‚Ä¢ The order book best bid/offer
‚Ä¢ The raw trade feed
Then look for trades which occur inbetween the bid/ask.
This would indicate a trade took place which no one else was able to execute because the trade never appeared on the order
book for anyone to be able to see, to then take.

South Korea Will Create A Cryptocurrency
For Citizen Rewards
The Seoul Metropolitan Government
will establish its first blockchain-based
administrative services in November,
according to a report in the korean-
language blockinpress.
At a conference held last month and at-
tended by city officials and representatives
of the private sector, specifics of the roll
out were discussed, with timelines and goals
established. The meeting seemed to revive
an initiative that had lost some momentum
since fƒ±rst being announced late last year.
Three priorities were
the November deadline. The city's block-
chain points system will be introduced and
residents of Seoul will receive s-coins for
for completion by
the use of public services. They will be able
to redeem those points for rewards. Services
that generate the coins include paying taxes
and participating in public opinion polls.
Seoul's point system will integrated with
Zeropay, a city-government sponsored
QR-code-enabled network established last
December. It allows customers to pay for
goods and services using their phones and
does not charge merchants commissions.

January 30, 2020
Novel Coronavirus Disease
We are closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new)
coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Thousands of
cases have been identified in China, with more than 100 fatalities. Additional cases
have been identified throughout the world, including the United States.
VA is closely tracking the occurrence of novel coronavirus in the United States and
prepared to protect the Veterans within the VA health care system and the employees
who serve them. Meanwhile, here are some important points I want to emphasize:
1. The illness is spread by respiratory droplets, similar to influenza, and symptoms
can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may appear 2-14 days
after exposure. There is much more to learn about the transmission and severity
of the coronavirus, and updates are available on the CDC webpage.
2. Our VHA Emergency Management Coordination Team is working with the Centers
for Disease Control and will stay on top of this situation as it changes. We are
working to be as prepared as possible so that each facility has a plan and training
to assess and begin the care of any Veteran or staff who arrives needing an
evaluation for potential exposure.
3. We will continually update you and the Veteran community as we receive more
information.
There is currently no vaccine to prevent an infection, although there are concentrated
efforts to develop and test solutions. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being
exposed to this virus, with everyday_preventive actions such as:
‚Ä¢ Getting a flu shot.
‚Ä¢ Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
(suggestion: scrub while humming the ""Happy Birthday"" song from beginning to
end twice).
‚Ä¢ Using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.
‚Ä¢ Staying home when you are sick or becoming sick.
‚Ä¢ Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
‚Ä¢ Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Avoiding all non-essential travel to China.
‚Ä¢ If you do travel to China, call employee health before returning to work.
These basic health measures can make a huge difference in reducing the spread of
infection and can save lives.

Shanghai | Thousands of Chinese tourists
planning to travel to Australia over the next
two months have been forced to cancel their
trips after Beijing slapped a ban on tour
groups overseas in an effort to control the
spread of the coronavirus.
Tour operators in China said on Monday they
had been told the ban would be in place for
as long as two months, a crippling blow for
Australia's tourism industry, which is already
reeling from months of devastating bushfires
and relies heavily on visitors from China.

a 0.225% slope on average. This is about 1/10th of the
slope people normally engineer into their walkways so
they drain surface rain water.

climate change
The minister for climate change Greg Baker recently said that
crowdfunding could be an ""incredibly powerful"" way to deliver a
""decentralised energy system, and help achieve the goal of turning the
Big Six into the Big 60,000."" It may sound fanciful, with community-
owned renewable schemes only existing in the UK on a very small
scale. But in Germany, over 50% of renewable-energy capacity is
community-owned. And online crowdfunding or peer-to-peer (P2P)
lending, allowing individuals to lend or raise money for projects
directly, could be set to kick-start community-ownership of renewable
energy in the UK too.

New Crop Varieties for Extreme Weather,
Geneva Greenhouses, New York State
Agricultural Experiment Station, New York, 2013
New varieties of grapes, peppers, and raspberries are grown and
tested under high-voltage lamps at the Agricultural Experiment
Station in Geneva, New York. Scientists race to create climate-
change-resilient agriculture. By crossbreeding domesticated
crops with their wild ancestors, they propagate superhardy
strains that can withstand droughts, heat waves, and freezes.
As erratic weather patterns intensify, farmers need crops that
can cope with such stresses.

Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses
that are common among animals. In rare
cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic,
meaning they can be transmitted from
animals to humans.
The viruses can make people sick, usually
with a mild to moderate upper respiratory
tract illness, similar to a common cold.

Mr Turnbull also noted the pressure placed by his father's government on AGL to keep its ailing

""Such spending is like trying to keep crappy cars ‚Äì like a 1994 Ford Laser ‚Äì on the road.""

St. Roch (ship)
Âàò
‚òÜ
RCMPV St. Roch is a Royal Canadian Mounted Police schooner, the first ship to completely
circumnavigate North America, and the second sailing vessel to complete a voyage through
the Northwest Passage. She was the first ship to complete the Northwest Passage in the
direction west to east (Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean), going the same route that Amundsen
on the sailing vessel Gj√∏a went east to west, 38 years earlier.
The ship was most often captained by
Henry Larsen.[2]
Liverpool born Sgt. Fred S. Farrar
R.C.M.P. (1901-1954) was a crew member

gender and ethnic susceptibility to 2019-nCoV
Entry of Corona-chan into lung cells is through cell surface
expression of ACE2(angiotensin converting enzyme 2), which
Corona-chan recognizes with the bling of her crown (the
projections of her eponymous Corona).
This is identical to the mechanism used by SARS-Coronavirus.
The significance of this finding can be inferred from known
expression of this enzyme on the surfaces of lung cells.
It is known that males have 30% higher expression of the enzyme
than females across all population groups. This fits with
observations that most of the deaths and infected patients are
males.
A second association that goes toward explaining the outbreak is
the association between ethnic group and enzyme expression.
A study on hypertension across three population groups (White
European, African, South Asian) found that hypertension
prevalence and ACE2 expression was proportionally linked, with
the highest of the three (South Asian) being 10% more than the
African and 35% more than the European cohorts.
The statistics here go a long way to explaining why the previous
SARS outbreak did little damage beyond Chinese borders and
shows the susceptibility of the Chinese population to zoonotic
Coronavirus infections, debunking theories that Corona-chan is a
test tube baby

We
humans have become just too powerful to suffer a global
famine without causing a mass extinction event.
It will be a famine where most of humanity still
dies in a quest for food and survival. It will be a famine
without hiding places, because hunger will cause people
to betray all secrets & ties in an age of shortwave radio. A
famine where machine-enabled men full of hunger, rage,
and blame make it their main thing in life to find every
bunker & cave. ""Open-up, or we will bust your bunker.""
Thus preparation, global cooperation, and a much
more trustworthy and universal form of democracy seem
the only sensible path forward through the end of days.
The current state of corrupt democracy will result in
nothing but a global catastrophe for everyone on Earth.
People are so keen to insure their cars, homes,
health, national defense and even travel arrangements.
What about our all-important need to eat? Isn't food
insurance more fundamental? The path we are blindly
following today leads to nothing but suffering for everyone
35) If the next ice age really is coming, we are fools not to
store-up many years (or decades) of food supplies while
the sun actually shines. Besides, today's 3-month
worldwide food buffer is still inadequate for another
Tambora-sized eruption, even if no ice age is coming.
and death for most of the world.
Grain is just so cheap. A 1-year supply is only
$140 per person. That's only +$1-trillion for the world, or
about 1.2% of world GDP. And we can still give the grain
to the poor before it expires, or feed livestock with it, or
make alcohol with it. So the net annual cost of say an 8-
year food buffer is only on net, maybe 0.4% of world GDP
annually.
If the grain is kept near freezing and in dry
oxygen-free containers, it will supposedly remain edible
for some 40 years. Thus we are capable of preparing for a
40-year total loss of agricultural output. Thus, we are able
to let everyone die of old age while we reduce our new
generations to whatever size we must reduce them to.
36) Now because I fear the selfishness and stupidity of
some people, I must point something out. It is that 7-billion
people will dig irrigation works for Earth's volcanos 10
times faster than 700-million. However, with regard to a
worldwide ice age famine, it makes little difference
So for those of you with an ear for the Devil's
music: Thanos was not right. Or rather, this horrible idea is
completely unnecessary if we just take some precautions
that are in fact, 10-to-100 times less costly than reducing
our CO2 output.
If we don't substantially increase our food buffer,
whether we are 7-billion or 700-million. We will still have a
humanity WILL eventually experience a huge murderous
famine of all famines at the dawn of the next ice age: A
famine where machine-enabled men comb the planet's
ecosystems looking for food, eating-up many of the
horrible murderous famine and eco-system catastrophe at
the dawn of the next ice age if we only have 3-months
food supply. Thus the primary problem is not to reduce
populations, but to have lots of food stored as a buffer.

Hunger and famine will
increase as food production
is destabilised by drought.
AIR
Pollution and pollen seasons
will increase leading to more
allergies and asthma.
Between 2030 and 2050 climate change is expected to cause

Dear Governor,
Per our discussion of today, Gulf Coast Funds Management EB-5 Regional Center currently has 83
pending EB-5 petitions at USCIS.
This means $41.5 million in stranded capital that should have been invested long ago in Tunica, MS,
and would have already created 830 jobs. As the attached chart indicates, many of these
applications have been pending far beyond the USCIS stated processing goal of 5 months. In
addition, 4 qualified investors ($2 million/40 jobs) just withdrew their funds due to the long delay
and chose to invest in a Canadian immigration investor program. A big loss to America and
Mississippi. We are concerned that this could start a stampede of investors asking for their money
back and investing in other countries. Senators Cochran and Wicker have both called USCIS Director
Alejandro Mayorkas and I recently met with Secretary Napolitano to voice my displeasure with the
program.
Mayorkas also has a connection to Anthony Rodham at Gulf Coast. Specifically, after
Anthony's brother, Hugh Rodham, received $200,000 in 2001 to lobby for clemency for a
convicted cocaine dealer and son of a major Democratic Party donor, Mayorkas-at the time a
57
Clinton-appointed U.S. Attorney_intervened by calling the White House Counsel's office.
Mayorkas admitted years later during a Senate confirmation hearing that making the call was ""a
¬ª58
mistake.
Congressional investigators recently found that GreenTech received special
treatment from immigration officials at the direction of Mayorkas, who communicated with
executives from Gulf Coast as well as from GreenTech-including McAuliffe himself-nearly a

>Hubei is only reporting Pneumonia cases because those are the ones they have resources to test
Entirely possible.
Someone else noticed this yesterday and I capped it just in case it came up again.
And it seemed ike it did.
They were running out of test kits earlier, so it can definitely be a case of them just saying
>Fuck it, we'l just test the ones with pneumonia, everyone else is a suspected case.
So, anons
This is fucking important, don't fucking ignore this, this might be fucking huge, alright?
These two translations are from the same translation service, so it should've made the same error on both, if it was an error.
>National report
At 04.00 on January 29, 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 1737 new confirmed cases

This is fucking serious guys.

This probably means that they aren't even taking in patients that don't have Pneumonia, that means it's really fucking bad.

THIS IS VERY FUCKING IMPORTANT /pol/
YOU BETTER FUCKING NOT IGNORE THIS
First of all, read the pic. That's the first part you need to be aware of.
Have you done that? Good. Now listen.
In China they have fever clinics. Now these fever clinics acts like a screening for the hospitals. If you have a fever, you don't visit the hospital first. you go to a fever clinic.
http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/features/Blog-Health_Wellness/72154/Here-are-Shanghais-designated-fever-clinics.html
In the Hubei reports, they have included the amount of people visiting fever clinics, and the amount of people ""seen"", which I guess is a shit translation. but I would assume that is people
they could check.
>Moonrunes anon helped translate that it means ""stay""., meaning they were admitted.
>http://wjw.hubei.gov.cr/fbjd/dtyw/202001/t20200130_2016304.shtml
>On January 28. a total of 32.309 people were treated for fever clinics in the province, and 4,095 people were seen (actual translation, stay, meaning they were admitted)
But if I'm reading this correctly, this means that 32309 people came with symptoms to fever clinics in Hubei district, and 4095 people could be treated, out of these there were 1032 cases
of pneumonia.
This means that 1 in 4 people get pneumonia.
>Many of the patients I interviewed said they showed all the signs of coronavirus infection but couldn't get a confirmed diagnosis for lack of definitive testing.
>When I visited the Red Cross Hospital Wednesday, the main hall was crowded with people wearing masks as the sounds of coughing echoed through the air. Many of the patients in the
hallways had IV drips while others waited anxiously to be tested or treated.
>Several people showed me their CT scan results. which were highly suggestive of coronavirus infection, but they said they were yet to receive a confirmed diagnosis and thus couldn't be
admitted to the hospital.
>i know I am probably a mobile source of virus, but there is nothing I can do if the hospital doesn't receive me."" said a suspected coronavirus patient surnamed Li. He told me he was
unable to get the virus test because the hospital ran out of testing kits. As patients are mixed in the hospital, the risk of cross-infection is massive, he said.
>A doctor at the Red Cross Hospital said only a few public hospitals in Wuhan were equipped with testing gear for the new coronavirus and the Red Cross Hospital was not among them. The
hospital can only report suspected cases to the provincial disease control center, which will take samples for testing. It is unclear how many tests the center has done, but when I asked six
people with lung infections showing on their CT scans at the Red Cross Hospital, none of them had received a test.
>Without testing, many patients have yet to be confirmed as coronavirus infections despite highly suspicious symptoms and CT results. one hospital staffer in Wuhan told me.

The premise of President Obama's Climate Action Plan is that there is an overwhelming judgment of
science that anthropogenic global warming is already producing devastating impacts, which is
summarized by this statement from the President's Second Inaugural Address:
Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the
devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.
This premise is not strongly supported by scientific evidence:
‚Ä¢ the science of climate change is not settled, and evidence reported by the IPCC AR5 weakens
the case for human factors dominating climate change in the 20th and early 21*‚Äú centuries
with the 15+ year hiatus in global warming, there is growing appreciation for the importance of
natural climate variability
the IPCC AR5 and SREX find little evidence that supports an increase in most extreme weather
events that can be attributed to humans, and weather extremes in the U.S. were generally worse
in the 1930's and 1950's than in recent decades.

Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses
that are common among animals. In rare
cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic,
meaning they can be transmitted from
animals to humans.
The viruses can make people sick, usually
with a mild to moderate upper respiratory

2018 SPPA Alumni Reception
Dear SPPA alumni,
Every year the School of Public Policy and Administration (SPPA) welcomes new students into our programs. This
year, we are organizing an alumni reception for the close of the first week of school to help integrate these new
students into our Ottawa community.
We invite you to join us! SPPA alumni, please come out to welcome our new students and re-connect with fellow
graduates.
The reception will take place from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm on Friday, September 7 in the Atrium of Richcraft Hall on
Carleton University Campus. Matt Jones - Assistant Deputy Minister, Pan-Canadian Framework Implementation
Office, Environment and Climate Change Canada and MAPA graduate 2001 - will offer brief remarks to the
incoming students, giving them advice on how to best use their two years at Carleton.
The reception will follow an Induction Exercise held from 1:30 pm to 4:45 pm that will focus on Canada's Opioid
Crisis. Alumni are welcome to attend this event also.
For more details and to register for the exercise and reception, please visit https://carleton.ca/sppa/cu-

We hope to see you on September 7!

China's Banks May Take a $800

By Bloomberg News
Bad loan ratio seen tripling if virus crisis
persists
China regional banks already under stress
amid slowing economy
(Bloomberg) -- China's beleaguered
banks could take a $800 billion hit as the
spreading coronavirus threatens large
swaths of the world's second-largest
economy.
That's according to a new prediction for
the world's biggest banking system by
rating firm S&P Global. A prolonged
health emergency could cause the
system's non-performing loan ratio to
more than triple to about 6.3%.

Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses
that are common among animals. In rare
cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic,
meaning they can be transmitted from
animals to humans.
The viruses can make people sick, usually
with a mild to moderate upper respiratory
tract illness, similar to a common cold.

Using science to sell apps: Evaluation of mental health app
store quality claims
Mark Erik Larsen', Kit Huckvale', Jennifer Nicholas?, John Torous, Louise Birrell"", Emily Li' and Bill Reda'
Despite the emergence of curated app libraries for mental health apps, personal searches by consumers remain a common method
for discovering apps. App store descriptions therefore represent a key channel to inform consumer choice. This study examined the
claims invoked through these app store descriptions, the extent to which scientific language is used to support such claims, and the
corresponding evidence in the literature. Google Play and iTunes were searched for apps related to depression, self-harm,
substance use, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The descriptions of the top-ranking, consumer-focused apps were coded to identify
claims of acceptability and effectiveness, and forms of supporting statement. For apps which invoked ostensibly scientific
principles, a literature search was conducted to assess their credibility. Seventy-three apps were coded, and the majority (64%)
claimed effectiveness at diagnosing a mental health condition, or improving symptoms, mood or self-management. Scientific
language was most frequently used to support these effectiveness claims (44%), although this included techniques not validated by
literature searches (8/24 = 33%). Two apps described low-quality, primary evidence to support the use of the app. Only one app
included a citation to published literature. A minority of apps (14%) described design or development involving lived experience,
and none referenced certification or accreditation processes such as app libraries. Scientific language was the most frequently
invoked form of support for use of mental health apps; however, high-quality evidence is not commonly described. Improved
knowledge translation strategies may improve the adoption of other strategies, such as certification or lived experience co-design.

Every degree of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming https://t.co/cVlR0Rb3Yr #bcwildfire https://t.co/dAx59bKpix","The answer lies in the summer's record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts.
Days of near-10o-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West
in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in
early August.
""This will become an important year for [anecdotes about] the importance of
temperature. Despite the fact that these forests were really soaked down this
winter and spring, these heat waves have dried things out enough to promote
really large fires,"" says Park Williams, a research scientist at the Lamont-
Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.
In other words, the weeks of heat that baked the West in July and August were
enough to wipe away some of the fire-dampening effect of the winter storms.
""The last 60 to 90 days have been exceptionally warm and dry, the perfect
recipe for drying out fuels (the one ingredient besides ignitions you need for
fire in these systems),"" said John Abatzoglou, a professor of geography at the
University of Idaho, in an email. ‚ÄúI was running a few numbers this morning,
and the last 60 days have been record warm from Spokane, Washington, to
Medford, Oregon; both Seattle and Missoula earlier this summer set records for
the longest number of days without measurable rain.""
This excessive heat can have an outsize effect on the size of forest fires. For
more than three decades, wildfire researchers have known that fire and aridity,
which is controlled by heat, exist in an exponential relationship. Every degree
of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming,
Williams said.
""Now, thinking about temperature trends due to human-caused climate
change, we think that the western United States is 1.5 [degrees] Celsius, or 3
degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than it would be in absence of climate change. And
there's a heat wave on top of that,"" said Williams. ""Because of the exponential
influence of temperature, that means that this heat wave is having a way worse
influence on fire than it would in absence of human-caused warming.""

Just so we are clear, ""Climate Change""
measures changes over time in the statistics
of the weather (as well as state of the
oceans, ice, etc.). Those statistics include
averages but also extremes. So trends in
record heat, drought, floods, etc. are
measures of climate change too.

Notice of Public Lecture
Heritage in the Age of Climate Change
The movement to preserve our built heritage has changed
dramatically over the last 50 years. Environmental issues have become
a major consideration. ""Cities, and the buildings which comprise them,
account for more than 75% of the world's greenhouse gasses. That's the
bad news. The good news is that building super-efficient new buildings
doesn't help fix the problem: rehabilitating and repurposing old
buildings does. As Carl Elephante, president of the American Institute of
Architects says, 'the greenest building is one that's already built."" Erik
Hanson, Heritage Resources Coordinator for the City of Peterborough,
will explain why heritage is the emerging champion in the race to zero
net carbon and discuss what municipalities and the private sector can do
to support the sustainable rehabilitation of existing buildings.
Tuesday, 18 September, 2018, The Lion's Centre, 347 Burnham
Street, 7:30 p.m. (accessible, parking, free admission) All welcome.

""Good morning, Due to heavier than normal ice
concentrations in the Canadian arctic waters north of 70
degrees, the Canadian Coast Guard, recommends that
pleasure craft do not navigate in the Beaufort Sea, Barrow,
Peel Sound, Franklin Strait and Prince Regent. CCG
icebreakers cannot safely escort pleasure craft. Operators
of pleasure craft considering a northwest passage should
also consider the risk of having to winter in a safe haven in
the Arctic, or in the case of an emergency, be evacuated
from beset vessels. Safety of mariners is our primary
concern.

Cyber Security
Small Charity Guide
This advice has been produced to help charities protect themselves
from the most common cyber attacks. The 5 topics covered are easy to
understand and cost little to implement. Read our quick tips below, or
find out more at www.ncsc.gov.uk/charity.
a part of GCHO
Backing up your data
Preventing malware damage
Using passwords to
Take regular backups of your important
data, and test they can be restored. This
will reduce the inconvenience of any
data loss from theft, fire, other
physical damage, or ransomware.
You can protect your charity from the
damage caused by 'malware' (malicious
software, including viruses) by adopting
some simple and low-cost techniques.
protect your data
Passwords - when implemented
correctly - are a free, easy and
effective way to prevent
unauthorised people from
accessing your devices and data.
Identify what needs to be backed up. Normally this
will comprise documents, emails, contacts, legal
information, calendars, financial records and
supporter or beneficiary databases.
Use antivirus software on all computers and laptops.
Only install approved software on tablets and
smartphones, and prevent users from downloading
third party apps from unknown sources.
Patch all software and firmware by promptly
applying the latest software updates provided by
manufacturers and vendors. Use the 'automatically
update' option where available.
Make sure all laptops, MACS and PCs
use encryption products that require a
password to boot. Switch on password/
PIN protection or fingerprint
recognition for mobile devices.
Ensure the device containing your backup is not
permanently connected to the device holding the
original copy, neither physically nor over a local
network.
Consider backing up to the cloud. This means your
data is stored in a separate location (away from
your offices/devices), and you'll also be able to
access it quickly, from anywhere.
Control access to removable media such as SD cards
and USB sticks. Consider disabling ports, or limiting
access to sanctioned media. Encourage staff to
transfer files via email or cloud storage instead.
Use two factor authentication (2FA)
for important websites like banking
and email, if you're given the option.
Switch on your firewall (included with most
operating systems) to create a buffer zone between
your network and the Internet.
Avoid using predictable passwords
(such as family and pet names). Avoid
the most common passwords that
criminals can guess (like password).
Keeping your smartphones
(and tablets) safe
Smartphones and tablets
(which are used outside the
safety of the office and home)
need even more protection than 'desktop' equipment.
Avoiding phishing attacks
In phishing attacks, scammers send fake
emails asking for sensitive information
(such as bank details), or containing links
to bad websites.
Do not enforce regular password
changes; they only need to be changed
when you suspect a compromise.
Change the manufacturers' default
**T passwords that devices are issued with,
before they are distributed to staff.
Switch on PIN/password protection/fingerprint
recognition for mobile devices.
Ensure staff don't browse the web or check emails
from an account with Administrator privileges. This
will reduce the impact of successful phishing attacks.
Provide secure storage so staff can
write down passwords and keep
them safe (but not with the
device). Ensure staff can reset
their own passwords, easily.
Configure devices so that when lost or stolen they
can be tracked, remotely wiped or remotely locked.
Scan for malware and change passwords as soon as
possible if you suspect a successful attack has
occurred. Don't punish staff if they get caught out
(it discourages people from reporting in the future).
Keep your devices (and all installed apps) up to date,
using the 'automatically update' option if available.
Consider using a password
manager. If you do use one,
make sure that the 'master'
password (that provides
access to all your other
passwords) is a
strong one.
When sending sensitive data, don't connect to public
Wi-Fi hotspots - use 3G or 4G connections (including
tethering and wireless dongles) or use VPNS.
****
Check for obvious signs of phishing, like poor
spelling and grammar, or low quality versions of
recognisable logos. Does the sender's email address
look legitimate, or is it trying to mimic someone
you know?
Replace devices that are no longer supported by
manufacturers with up-to-date alternatives.

NOVEL CORONAVIRUS ( NCOV) - The name for this
kind of virus comes from the crownlike spikes it has
on its surface‚Äì ""corona"" is Latin for ""crown.""
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that infect
mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. In rare cases,
they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they
can be transmitted from animals to humans,
according to the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
The viruses can make people sick, usually with a mild
to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a
common cold.

The plastic industry creates billions and
billions of tonnes of carbon pollution
every year, which is the key cause of
climate change. For starters, most plastic
is made from oil or gas which are fossil
fuels that in turn use other fossil fuels to
be extracted from the ground. Then
there's the transportation, manufacturing
and disposal of the plastic to account
for.
Take 'disposable' plastic water bottles
for example. The carbon footprint of one
of these boffles is 82.8 grams of carbon.

PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI RENAMES COMMUNICATIONS MINISTRY
TO FEDERAL MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS AND DIGITAL ECONOMY
The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, has
granted the prayers of the Honourable Minister of Communications Dr Isa Ali
Ibrahim Pantami FNCS, FBCS, FIIM to properly position and empower the Ministry to
fulfill his Digital Economy objectives. The Ministry which supervises the ICT Sector
has been renamed The Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital
Economy to further expand its mandate to capture the goals of digitalization of the
Nigerian economy in line with the Economic Growth and Recovery Plan (EGRP), one
of the key agenda of the present administration.
According to the Honourable Minister, the former name was not only limiting in
pursuing the objectives of a digital economy, but obsolete as it did not reflect the
the trends as emphasized by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). 1ICT
contribution to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stood at 13.85% in the
second quarter of 2019. The change of nomenclature will propel the Ministry to
reposition its strategic objectives as laid out in the priority areas of this
administration while accelerating growth and social inclusion.
Dr Pantami cited examples of global and African economies like Scotland, Thailand,
Tunisia, Benin Republic and Burkina Faso among others who have adopted
deliberate strategies and created Ministries of Digital Economy in line with global
best practice, and especially the European Union which has a commissioner for
Digital Economy.
In a letter containing his approval, the President noted that the request is in line
with global best practice which will further reflect the priorities of his administration.
The approved name has been announced and adopted by the Federal Executive
Council today, 23 October 2019.

Hello Hassan,
Thank you for your thorough e-mail!
We can accommodate the 6 students in our
online classes in December, and in the
meantime I will be looking for more funds for
you so we can bring the program to Nigeria.
Please give me the names and e-mails of your 6
students, and our trainers will give them a call
and get them scheduled.
Happy to have the phone conversation.
My best,

That would be with the BC Liberals. Over 10
years between 2006 and 2015 they spent
only $8 million a year to remove fuels from
just 80,000 of a total 685,000 hectares of
high-risk forest land that urgently needs
action. And another one million hectares
also require treatment to prevent fires.
At the same time, it cost the B.C.
government an average $182 million every
year to fight forest fires ‚Äì more than $1.8
billion in total.
And this summer so far the province has
spent $100 million to pay some of the
unexpected expenses of thousands of
evacuated residents and $204 million to
fight the fires.
It's the epitome of the old saying: ‚ÄúPenny
wise, pound foolish.""

Stabilization wedges: solving the
climate problem for the next 50
years with current technologies
Stephen Pacala, Robert Socolow
science 305 (5686), 968-972, 2004
Humanity already possesses the fundamental
scientific, technical, and industrial know-how
to solve the carbon and climate problem for
the next half-century. A portfolio of
technologies now exists to meet the world9s
energy needs over the next 50 years and limit
atmospheric CO2 to a trajectory that avoids a
doubling of the preindustrial concentration.
Every element in this portfolio has passed
beyond the laboratory bench and
demonstration project; many are already
implemented somewhere at full industrial
scale. Although no element is a credible
candidate for doing the entire job (or even half
the job) by itself, the portfolio as a whole is
large enough that not every element has to be
used.

Pls tell ur families, relatives and friends
MOH Health Bulletin to the Public:
The Upper Respiratory Infection affecting China at present is quite serious. The virus causing it is very
potent and is resistant to existing antibiotics.
(virus is not bacterial infection hence cannot be treated by antibiotics).
The prevention method now is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold
your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within
10 mins. Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age. Everytime you feel your throat is
dry, do not wait, keep water in hand. Do not drink plenty at one time as it does not help; instead, continue to
keep throat moist. Till end of March, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train
or public transportation.
Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C.
The symptoms/ description are:
1. Repeated high fever.
2. Prolonged coughing after fever.
3. Children are more prone.
4. Adults usually feel uneasy, headache and mainly respiratory related illness.
This illness is highly contagious. Let's continue to pray and wait for further notice about the infection.
Please share.

AAA Just say one thing! Everyone knows the seriousness! But at this
time I can only express it here! The crematoriums of major funeral homes
in Wuhan are currently working 24 hours! I am 100% sure! Before, it was
only half a day to open the stove! Even in special circumstances, it is only a
full day shift! I've never heard of a crematorium working 24 hours anyway!

You can reduce the effects of climate
and help our redwood forests
by lowering carbon emissions. Ask your civic leaders to advocate for more
renewable energy production, including solar and wind, and to improve
transportation options, such as more bike lanes and better public transit.

Over the years and with your support, we've been testing and
refining our fully self-driving technology - including cars without a
trained driver up front.
We're excited to share that soon you may experience one of these
driverless rides!
Here's what you can expect:
‚Ä¢ If you get matched with a fully driverless car, you'll see a
notification in your Waymo app that confirms the car won't
have a trained driver up front.
‚Ä¢ You'll also see a ""What to expect"" button in your app, which
you can tap to learn more about our driverless rides.
‚Ä¢ You can enjoy having the car all to yourself.
‚Ä¢ As always, if you need assistance during any part of your trip,
you can contact a rider support agent through the car's help
button or in your app.
Rest assured, Waymo will still be taking care of you%; this is just the
next step as we travel down the road toward a fully self-driving
future. Thank you for joining us on this journey! If you have any
questions, you can contact support.

Peer Review A Synopsis https://t.co/y56euqzknT","Peer Review Is Cargo Cult ""Science""
'many of the most influential texts in
the history of science were never put
through the peer review process,
including Isaac Newton's 1687
Principia Mathematica, Albert
Einstein's 1905 paper on relativity,
and James Watson and Francis
Crick's 1953 Nature paper on the
structure of DNA.""
Melinda Baldwin
Did Isaac Newton Need Peer Review?
Peer review is cargo cult science. Exhaustive attempts to prove it raises
research quality have come up empty. On the other hand, its
shortcomings (inconsistency, superficiality, subjectivity, inability to
detect fraud, tribalism) are legion. If a series of pre-publication steps are
followed, goes this cargo cult thinking, sound science is the end result.
Academia has mythologized peer review. In that universe, it isn't a
mundane editorial tool, but a sacred process by which unpublished
research gets elevated and anointed and transformed into 'real' work
you can point to when applying for grants and promotions.
One of the dirty little secrets of this mythology is that journals have
always been at liberty to define peer review however they please.
External oversight, enforcement, and minimum standards have never
been part of the picture.

the appropriateness of her serving

particular concern is her spreading
conspiracy theories that vaccines

critical to the health and safety of

Sinth
Our two-person household considers climate change an urgent problem. So far, wve have cut our house's carbon
dioxide emissions by nearly 10,000 pounds per year. Here's a quick story about our most recent climate action.
In May 2017, we replaced our old natural gas-fired hot water heater with a heat pump water heater. This
appliance produces hot water by extracting heat from the ambient air surrounding it, employing the same
technology that refrigerators and air conditioners use to perform their work.
The highest-rated conventional storage water heaters and tankless water heaters have at best energy factors of 0.7
for natural gas units and 0.96 for electric resistance ones-meaning that at most 70 and 96 percent of the heat
produced by these heaters actually gets transferred to the water stored inside them. Heat pump water heaters,
however, can achieve energy factors of 2.0 or higher because these devices do not make heat but rather merely
transfer it from the surrounding air to the water inside the tank.
We now have a full year's worth of data and have analyzed the numbers. Replacing our gas water heater with a
heat pump water heater reduced our family's natural gas needs by at least 80 therms. Combusting one therm of
natural gas emits 11 pounds of carbon dioxide. Therefore, our household cut carbon dioxide pollution by at least
880 pounds per year with just this one climate action.
To power the new heat pump water heater, our electricity use increased by nine percent over the course of the
first year of operation. But since we pay on average seven cents extra per day to get the equivalent of 100 percent
of our power from Xcel Energy's Windsource, we achieved this big carbon reduction without adding any new
carbon pollution.
An additional bonus we have enjoyed is a dehumidified basement. Heat pump water heaters dehumidify as they
extract heat energy from the surrounding air. You may be able to reduce or even eliminate your use of a
basement dehumidifier.
Heat pump water heaters won't be right for every home. Since it works by extracting heat energy from the air
surrounding the device, it makes our basement cooler, drier and thus more comfortable in the summer. But it
also makes the basement colder in the winter. We use our basement only for laundry and storage, so a colder
basement in the winter causes us no discomfort. But a heat pump water heater may not be right for you if you
have a basement recreation room.
Fighting global warming will require that we find effective, affordable ways to use renewable energy to replace
natural gas and other fossil fuels to heat our water and heat and cool our homes and businesses. We encourage
you to consider a heat pump water heater when you next need to replace your existing unit.
