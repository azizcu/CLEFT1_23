This\nis because it exactly matches to the average depth of the\nnon-polar continental break, which is also about 135m\ndown depending on how we measure it.

But in cooling, it also\naccretes as rock the sea floor rift/ridge – like a tongue\ntouched to frozen metal, but on geological time scale. So\nwhile the bubbles of CO2-rich new volcanic air replenish\nthe atmosphere and bring up magma that warms the\nsurface, they also drive sea-floor spreading. Then this\nseafloor spreading drives earthquakes, plate margin\nvolcanos, and continental drift. Thus these 'soda bottle'\ngas bubbles are Gaia's primary driving force, directly or\nindirectly giving rise to all active geology, as well as\natmosphere and climate.

DOH, however, continues to guarantee the public that all necessary precautionary\nmeasures are being taken to halt the spread of the virus.\nThe confirmed case arrived in the Philippines from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong last January\n21, 2020. The patient sought consult and was admitted in one of the country's government\nhospitals last January 25 after experiencing mild cough. She is currently asymptomatic.\n\"I assure the public that the Department of Health is on top of this evolving situation. We were\nable to detect the first confirmed case because of our strong surveillance system, close\ncoórdination with World Health Organization and other national agencies, and the utilization of\nDOH's decision tool. We are working closely with the hospital where the patient is admitted and\nhave activated the Incident Command System of the said hospital for appropriate management,\nspecifically on infection control, case management, and containment. We are also implementing\nmeasures to protect the health staff providing care to these patients,\" Health Secretary Francisco\nT. Duque III said.\nDOH is also in close coordination with the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious\nDiseases (EID) which includes representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs (DFA),\nInterior and Local Government (DILG), Justice (DOJ), Labor and Employment (DOLE),\nTourism (DOT), Transportation (DOTT), and Information and Communications Technology\n(DICT). The Task Force will convene a high-level meeting tomorrow, January 31, 2020, to\ndiscuss the first confirmed case and developments arising from this health event.\nThe Bureau of Quarantine remains on high alert and is in constant coordination with authorities\nfrom all ports of entry for stricter border surveillance. DOH assured that its health facilities are\nequipped and prepared to receive and care for PUIS and confirmed 2019-nCoV cases.\n", "class_label": "Yes", "image_path": "images_labeled/train/1222832535698149376.jpg", "image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPhfs1mUYAUL3TA.jpg"}

Their advice is good for all of us. https://t.co/Z3Qye3EYaq", "ocr_text": "MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN CHARGE\nJanuary 30, 2020\nNovel Coronavirus Disease\nWe are closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new)\ncoronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Thousands of\ncases have been identified in China, with more than 100 fatalities. Additional cases\nhave been identified throughout the world, including the United States.\nVA is closely tracking the occurrence of novel coronavirus in the United States and\nprepared to protect the Veterans within the VA health care system and the employees\nwho serve them. Meanwhile, here are some important points I want to emphasize:\n1. The illness is spread by respiratory droplets, similar to influenza, and symptoms\ncan include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may appear 2-14 days\nafter exposure. There is much more to learn about the transmission and severity\nof the coronavirus, and updates are available on the CDC webpage.\n2. Our VHA Emergency Management Coordination Team is working with the Centers\nfor Disease Control and will stay on top of this situation as it changes. We are\nworking to be as prepared as possible so that each facility has a plan and training\nto assess and begin the care of any Veteran or staff who arrives needing an\nevaluation for potential exposure.\n3. We will continually update you and the Veteran community as we receive more\ninformation.\nThere is currently no vaccine to prevent an infection, although there are concentrated\nefforts to develop and test solutions. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being\nexposed to this virus, with everyday_preventive actions such as:\n• Getting a flu shot.\n• Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds\n(suggestion: scrub while humming the \"Happy Birthday\" song from beginning to\nend twice).\n• Using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\nAvoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\nAvoiding close contact with people who are sick.\n• Staying home when you are sick or becoming sick.\n• Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\n• Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.\nAvoiding all non-essential travel to China.\n• If you do travel to China, call employee health before returning to work.\nThese basic health measures can make a huge difference in reducing the spread of\ninfection and can save lives.\nRichard A. Stone, MD\nExecutive In Charge, VHA\n", "class_label": "Yes", "image_path": "images_labeled/train/1222971507724496901.jpg", "image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPjeGLuX4AAA_Pv.jpg"}

We\nhumans have become just too powerful to suffer a global\nfamine without causing a mass extinction event.\nIt will be a famine where most of humanity still\ndies in a quest for food and survival. It will be a famine\nwithout hiding places, because hunger will cause people\nto betray all secrets & ties in an age of shortwave radio. A\nfamine where machine-enabled men full of hunger, rage,\nand blame make it their main thing in life to find every\nbunker & cave. \"Open-up, or we will bust your bunker.\"\nThus preparation, global cooperation, and a much\nmore trustworthy and universal form of democracy seem\nthe only sensible path forward through the end of days.\nThe current state of corrupt democracy will result in\nnothing but a global catastrophe for everyone on Earth.\nPeople are so keen to insure their cars, homes,\nhealth, national defense and even travel arrangements.\nWhat about our all-important need to eat? Isn't food\ninsurance more fundamental? The path we are blindly\nfollowing today leads to nothing but suffering for everyone\n35) If the next ice age really is coming, we are fools not to\nstore-up many years (or decades) of food supplies while\nthe sun actually shines. Besides, today's 3-month\nworldwide food buffer is still inadequate for another\nTambora-sized eruption, even if no ice age is coming.\nand death for most of the world.\nGrain is just so cheap. A 1-year supply is only\n$140 per person. That's only +$1-trillion for the world, or\nabout 1.2% of world GDP. And we can still give the grain\nto the poor before it expires, or feed livestock with it, or\nmake alcohol with it. So the net annual cost of say an 8-\nyear food buffer is only on net, maybe 0.4% of world GDP\nannually.\nIf the grain is kept near freezing and in dry\noxygen-free containers, it will supposedly remain edible\nfor some 40 years. Thus we are capable of preparing for a\n40-year total loss of agricultural output. Thus, we are able\nto let everyone die of old age while we reduce our new\ngenerations to whatever size we must reduce them to.\n36) Now because I fear the selfishness and stupidity of\nsome people, I must point something out. It is that 7-billion\npeople will dig irrigation works for Earth's volcanos 10\ntimes faster than 700-million. However, with regard to a\nworldwide ice age famine, it makes little difference\nSo for those of you with an ear for the Devil's\nmusic: Thanos was not right. Or rather, this horrible idea is\ncompletely unnecessary if we just take some precautions\nthat are in fact, 10-to-100 times less costly than reducing\nour CO2 output.\nIf we don't substantially increase our food buffer,\nwhether we are 7-billion or 700-million. We will still have a\nhumanity WILL eventually experience a huge murderous\nfamine of all famines at the dawn of the next ice age: A\nfamine where machine-enabled men comb the planet's\necosystems looking for food, eating-up many of the\nhorrible murderous famine and eco-system catastrophe at\nthe dawn of the next ice age if we only have 3-months\nfood supply. Thus the primary problem is not to reduce\npopulations, but to have lots of food stored as a buffer.\n", "class_label": "No", "image_path": "images_labeled/train/1035278897464659970.jpg", "image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dl4MnE5XcAAuQB7.jpg"}

As the attached chart indicates, many of these\napplications have been pending far beyond the USCIS stated processing goal of 5 months. In\naddition, 4 qualified investors ($2 million/40 jobs) just withdrew their funds due to the long delay\nand chose to invest in a Canadian immigration investor program. A big loss to America and\nMississippi. We are concerned that this could start a stampede of investors asking for their money\nback and investing in other countries. Senators Cochran and Wicker have both called USCIS Director\nAlejandro Mayorkas and I recently met with Secretary Napolitano to voice my displeasure with the\nprogram.\nMayorkas also has a connection to Anthony Rodham at Gulf Coast. Specifically, after\nAnthony's brother, Hugh Rodham, received $200,000 in 2001 to lobby for clemency for a\nconvicted cocaine dealer and son of a major Democratic Party donor, Mayorkas-at the time a\n57\nClinton-appointed U.S. Attorney_intervened by calling the White House Counsel's office.\nMayorkas admitted years later during a Senate confirmation hearing that making the call was \"a\n»58\nmistake.\nCongressional investigators recently found that GreenTech received special\ntreatment from immigration officials at the direction of Mayorkas, who communicated with\nexecutives from Gulf Coast as well as from GreenTech-including McAuliffe himself-nearly a\n30 Josh Meyer, Alejandro Mayorkas Tapped to Head Immigration Agency, L.A.

App store descriptions therefore represent a key channel to inform consumer choice. This study examined the\nclaims invoked through these app store descriptions, the extent to which scientific language is used to support such claims, and the\ncorresponding evidence in the literature. Google Play and iTunes were searched for apps related to depression, self-harm,\nsubstance use, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The descriptions of the top-ranking, consumer-focused apps were coded to identify\nclaims of acceptability and effectiveness, and forms of supporting statement. For apps which invoked ostensibly scientific\nprinciples, a literature search was conducted to assess their credibility. Seventy-three apps were coded, and the majority (64%)\nclaimed effectiveness at diagnosing a mental health condition, or improving symptoms, mood or self-management. Scientific\nlanguage was most frequently used to support these effectiveness claims (44%), although this included techniques not validated by\nliterature searches (8/24 = 33%). Two apps described low-quality, primary evidence to support the use of the app. Only one app\nincluded a citation to published literature. A minority of apps (14%) described design or development involving lived experience,\nand none referenced certification or accreditation processes such as app libraries. Scientific language was the most frequently\ninvoked form of support for use of mental health apps; however, high-quality evidence is not commonly described. Improved\nknowledge translation strategies may improve the adoption of other strategies, such as certification or lived experience co-design.\nnpj Digital Medicine (2019)2:18; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-019-0093-1\n", "class_label": "No", "image_path": "images_labeled/train/1123353891779825669.jpg", "image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5b0QWHX4AA5_SN.png"}

The 5 topics covered are easy to\nunderstand and cost little to implement. Read our quick tips below, or\nfind out more at www.ncsc.gov.uk/charity.\na part of GCHO\nBacking up your data\nPreventing malware damage\nUsing passwords to\nTake regular backups of your important\ndata, and test they can be restored. This\nwill reduce the inconvenience of any\ndata loss from theft, fire, other\nphysical damage, or ransomware.\nYou can protect your charity from the\ndamage caused by 'malware' (malicious\nsoftware, including viruses) by adopting\nsome simple and low-cost techniques.\nprotect your data\nPasswords - when implemented\ncorrectly - are a free, easy and\neffective way to prevent\nunauthorised people from\naccessing your devices and data.\nIdentify what needs to be backed up. Normally this\nwill comprise documents, emails, contacts, legal\ninformation, calendars, financial records and\nsupporter or beneficiary databases.\nUse antivirus software on all computers and laptops.\nOnly install approved software on tablets and\nsmartphones, and prevent users from downloading\nthird party apps from unknown sources.\nPatch all software and firmware by promptly\napplying the latest software updates provided by\nmanufacturers and vendors. Use the 'automatically\nupdate' option where available.\nMake sure all laptops, MACS and PCs\nuse encryption products that require a\npassword to boot. Switch on password/\nPIN protection or fingerprint\nrecognition for mobile devices.\nEnsure the device containing your backup is not\npermanently connected to the device holding the\noriginal copy, neither physically nor over a local\nnetwork.\nConsider backing up to the cloud. This means your\ndata is stored in a separate location (away from\nyour offices/devices), and you'll also be able to\naccess it quickly, from anywhere.\nControl access to removable media such as SD cards\nand USB sticks. Consider disabling ports, or limiting\naccess to sanctioned media. Encourage staff to\ntransfer files via email or cloud storage instead.\nUse two factor authentication (2FA)\nfor important websites like banking\nand email, if you're given the option.\nSwitch on your firewall (included with most\noperating systems) to create a buffer zone between\nyour network and the Internet.\nAvoid using predictable passwords\n(such as family and pet names). Avoid\nthe most common passwords that\ncriminals can guess (like password).\nKeeping your smartphones\n(and tablets) safe\nSmartphones and tablets\n(which are used outside the\nsafety of the office and home)\nneed even more protection than 'desktop' equipment.\nAvoiding phishing attacks\nIn phishing attacks, scammers send fake\nemails asking for sensitive information\n(such as bank details), or containing links\nto bad websites.\nDo not enforce regular password\nchanges; they only need to be changed\nwhen you suspect a compromise.\nChange the manufacturers' default\n**T passwords that devices are issued with,\nbefore they are distributed to staff.\nSwitch on PIN/password protection/fingerprint\nrecognition for mobile devices.\nEnsure staff don't browse the web or check emails\nfrom an account with Administrator privileges. This\nwill reduce the impact of successful phishing attacks.\nProvide secure storage so staff can\nwrite down passwords and keep\nthem safe (but not with the\ndevice). Ensure staff can reset\ntheir own passwords, easily.\nConfigure devices so that when lost or stolen they\ncan be tracked, remotely wiped or remotely locked.\nScan for malware and change passwords as soon as\npossible if you suspect a successful attack has\noccurred. Don't punish staff if they get caught out\n(it discourages people from reporting in the future).\nKeep your devices (and all installed apps) up to date,\nusing the 'automatically update' option if available.\nConsider using a password\nmanager. If you do use one,\nmake sure that the 'master'\npassword (that provides\naccess to all your other\npasswords) is a\nstrong one.\nWhen sending sensitive data, don't connect to public\nWi-Fi hotspots - use 3G or 4G connections (including\ntethering and wireless dongles) or use VPNS.\n****\nCheck for obvious signs of phishing, like poor\nspelling and grammar, or low quality versions of\nrecognisable logos. Does the sender's email address\nlook legitimate, or is it trying to mimic someone\nyou know?\nReplace devices that are no longer supported by\nmanufacturers with up-to-date alternatives.\nwww\n© Crown Copyright 2018\nFor more information go to Q www.ncsc.gov.uk y@ncsc\n", "class_label": "No", "image_path": "images_labeled/train/1204300219682308097.jpg", "image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ELaIqhvX0AAApAx.jpg"}

The change of nomenclature will propel the Ministry to\nreposition its strategic objectives as laid out in the priority areas of this\nadministration while accelerating growth and social inclusion.\nDr Pantami cited examples of global and African economies like Scotland, Thailand,\nTunisia, Benin Republic and Burkina Faso among others who have adopted\ndeliberate strategies and created Ministries of Digital Economy in line with global\nbest practice, and especially the European Union which has a commissioner for\nDigital Economy.\nIn a letter containing his approval, the President noted that the request is in line\nwith global best practice which will further reflect the priorities of his administration.\nThe approved name has been announced and adopted by the Federal Executive\nCouncil today, 23 October 2019.\nSigned\nPhilomena Oshodin\nDeputy Director\nPress & Public Relations\n23rd October 2019\n", "class_label": "Yes", "image_path": "images_labeled/train/1187082826627330049.jpg", "image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHldh4dXUAEXUUM.jpg"}

The virus causing it is very\npotent and is resistant to existing antibiotics.\n(virus is not bacterial infection hence cannot be treated by antibiotics).\nThe prevention method now is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold\nyour thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within\n10 mins. Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age. Everytime you feel your throat is\ndry, do not wait, keep water in hand. Do not drink plenty at one time as it does not help; instead, continue to\nkeep throat moist. Till end of March, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train\nor public transportation.\nAvoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C.\nThe symptoms/ description are:\n1. Repeated high fever.\n2. Prolonged coughing after fever.\n3. Children are more prone.\n4. Adults usually feel uneasy, headache and mainly respiratory related illness.\nThis illness is highly contagious. Let's continue to pray and wait for further notice about the infection.\nPlease share.\nSent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.\n", "class_label": "Yes", "image_path": "images_labeled/train/1222872953756368896.jpg", "image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPiEdx8UwAEk3XO.jpg"}

So far, wve have cut our house's carbon\ndioxide emissions by nearly 10,000 pounds per year. Here's a quick story about our most recent climate action.\nIn May 2017, we replaced our old natural gas-fired hot water heater with a heat pump water heater. This\nappliance produces hot water by extracting heat from the ambient air surrounding it, employing the same\ntechnology that refrigerators and air conditioners use to perform their work.\nThe highest-rated conventional storage water heaters and tankless water heaters have at best energy factors of 0.7\nfor natural gas units and 0.96 for electric resistance ones-meaning that at most 70 and 96 percent of the heat\nproduced by these heaters actually gets transferred to the water stored inside them. Heat pump water heaters,\nhowever, can achieve energy factors of 2.0 or higher because these devices do not make heat but rather merely\ntransfer it from the surrounding air to the water inside the tank.\nWe now have a full year's worth of data and have analyzed the numbers. Replacing our gas water heater with a\nheat pump water heater reduced our family's natural gas needs by at least 80 therms. Combusting one therm of\nnatural gas emits 11 pounds of carbon dioxide. Therefore, our household cut carbon dioxide pollution by at least\n880 pounds per year with just this one climate action.\nTo power the new heat pump water heater, our electricity use increased by nine percent over the course of the\nfirst year of operation. But since we pay on average seven cents extra per day to get the equivalent of 100 percent\nof our power from Xcel Energy's Windsource, we achieved this big carbon reduction without adding any new\ncarbon pollution.\nAn additional bonus we have enjoyed is a dehumidified basement. Heat pump water heaters dehumidify as they\nextract heat energy from the surrounding air. You may be able to reduce or even eliminate your use of a\nbasement dehumidifier.\nHeat pump water heaters won't be right for every home. Since it works by extracting heat energy from the air\nsurrounding the device, it makes our basement cooler, drier and thus more comfortable in the summer. But it\nalso makes the basement colder in the winter. We use our basement only for laundry and storage, so a colder\nbasement in the winter causes us no discomfort. But a heat pump water heater may not be right for you if you\nhave a basement recreation room.\nFighting global warming will require that we find effective, affordable ways to use renewable energy to replace\nnatural gas and other fossil fuels to heat our water and heat and cool our homes and businesses. We encourage\nyou to consider a heat pump water heater when you next need to replace your existing unit.\n", "class_label": "No", "image_path": "images_labeled/train/1035178152505602056.jpg", "image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dl2vntEXoAAt859.jpg"}
